I have an immense luxury in being able to spend time penning this post outlining my year; *this* year. Over 1.7 million people have lost their lives, over 80 million have had the virus, and countless others have felt its touch through personal losses and sacrifices. In many ways, writing an outline of my year is a perverse, narcissistic and pretentious endeavour, and I do not think for a minute that prefacing the oncoming paragraphs with this small acknowledgement of the sacrifices of 2020 nullifies this. 

This 'year in review' format, which people traditionally use to note their recent achievements, seems out of touch with the ways of the world this year. Make no mistake: anyone that has been able to reach the end of the 2020 with their sense of self intact has achieved more than most impressive individuals in a normal year. Every one of us has had to grapple with separation and disassociation, from our families, friends, routines, and ourselves. So I do not head into this with a light and breezy attitude; I am aware of my privilege, and I am immensely grateful to those who have protected it and all of those who have sacrificed something for it. As the vaccines continue to roll out across the world, my biggest hope is that at the end of 2021, we are able to look back on our shared journey, and hug our loved ones tighter as a result.

Writing my thoughts in a sporadic journal like affair has been one of my biggest supports over the last few years. A habit I picked up in sixth form, it has become all the more valuable in this time. My head has been too full too often this year; with so much going on, both personally and globally, it has been easy to lose yourself in the forest. For me, this has manifested in a paralysing 'cog fog', leaving me unproductive and disheartened. The biggest antidote to this has been mindfulness: meditation and letting my thoughts spill out onto the paper. And so this review becomes the final tsunami of thoughts for this year.

2020 has been about people, in every sense. I think this is true for every year, to be honest. In my 2019 review, I noted: "I have been incredibly lucky to spend time at these places with fantastic people, and the experiences of those trips will stay with me forever", and although I stand by the statement, I feel a need to revise this to be up to 2020-standard: "I have been incredibly lucky to spend time with fantastic people, and memories of those people will stay with me forever". Because this has been a big theme of the year for me: I have been spending a lot of time looking forward and backwards, almost living vicariously through the memories and experiences of those I knew, and have come to know. Something about this year has presented a somewhat temporal instability; with no discernible present to live in (with the exception of eating, drinking, and whatever project I've been busy with - a life without the social component), it makes sense that I'd fall back to the past, where my greatest loves and losses have taken place, and to the future, where there is the unlimited potential for both successes and failures.

## 2020 Begins: The future is now

The start of this year was one of great promise and intrigue. I had learned on 16th January that I would in fact be starting as a placement student at Amazon Web Services in Dublin. This held a double duty in 'big life changes': the chance at my dream of working in big tech, and the ability to leave the UK and start on my geographical journey across the world. 

The opportunities that this move could present to me were tantalising. I was eager to learn more about how the big tech companies work at such scale, and how their relationship with my big technical interest: decentralisation. The fault mechanisms at Amazon were something that I was very eager to explore, and seeing how the world of programming and software development felt with the Amazon peculiarities was definitely my planned biggest takeaway from my year in Dublin.

Of course, I also had my final undergraduate year to finish in Sheffield, something which was all consuming at the start of 2020. I had my custom-topic dissertation on how peer to peer technologies can transform business to business transactions as well as slew of other modules to complete. I was grappling with leaving the city of my first tastes of independence and self-sufficiency - and leaving my lovely network of friends behind. 

In this period, I had intended to write a post about leaving Sheffield, my university city, and moving to Dublin. In that draft, I wrote the following:

> The chance to find yourself is ever-present in life, and I think in my earlier youthful arrogance/vitriol assumed that this was an atomic process that happened at stage x in your life. The phrase ‘find yourself’ implies that you are an object which is simply lost, like your keys behind a couch cushion. But really, **‘finding yourself’ is not so much a conscious process, but a subtle series of changes over the course of many months and years;** over your life. I, like the rest of the planet, have not ‘found myself’. I am closer to myself, but I certainly wasn’t hiding behind a cushion.

And really, I think that is one of the biggest takeaways from this year: trying to grapple with the immense difficulties that have been thrust on the world, all the while trying to maintain composure in my own ever changing landscape has been a Ship of Theseus situation - my environment, support mechanisms, activities, and sense of self were all changed this year. 

Being unable to return home to see my family, my ultimate and unwavering support, for the majority of the year, all the while embarking on a new Ireland-based life, has tested my sense of self greater than I had anticipated. The permitted Christmas reconciliation between these two Toms has been a welcome break in the turmoil of this year, and something which has allowed me the space to pen this review.

## The People and Observability

And yet, despite the feeling of living in a bubble that my months in Dublin gave me, I have been made to feel whole by the people I have met and the connections I have achieved. My team at AWS, who have let me explore facets of Amazon's infrastructure as well as programming concepts dear to my heart, have been an invaluable support in this time. In particular, my manager Peter, and my co-workers Sheldon and Victor, have paved the way for me to explore and develop at my own pace, both professionally and personally, have shown the *real* value in big tech - the people.

And then, my flatmates Conall and Lee, and their friends (Gina), who I am indebted to for bringing me into the fold, and letting me live with them - not just in the confines of our house. The memories that I treasure this year have very little to do with location or spectacle, but rather the lasting imprint of genuine connection. The people I have connected with this year, both new or old, have shown me new depths of understanding on **observability**. This year, in the year of isolation and masks, I have felt seen. I have felt **the click**, the understanding between two people, where words are not required. And the crazy thing? I've felt the click with so many people. Trust the click.

You know that clicking feeling? You *do* know that clicking feeling. You've had it a few times in your life. That click makes you put your inhibitions to the side, makes you open up and spill your secrets, and talk about the things that make you embarrassed. The click is the key opening the vault of vulnerability, and there is no locksmith in the world that can copy it. I've learned to trust the click.

Working for Amazon Web Services has been everything I anticipated and more. I am indebted to my team there, who have let me explore in my style, to niches of Amazon and software engineering I did not anticipate to uncover. Working with the RDS team has been rewarding and just generally lovely, and my technical skills have improved considerably. Specifically, dealing with CI/CD, pipelining processes, and mentally dealing with a system that is too complex to understand in its entirety have been the big takeaways so far. Unobserved and unobservable complexity are two areas that my work (and personal life) have focussed on, and trying to deal with the concept of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknowns in a professional setting at such scale are skills are know I would not have been able to develop to the degree I have anywhere else but Amazon. 

2020 has been a bit of a watershed year for me, and as I continue on my journey to better understand myself, society and software, I am grateful to all those who have provided guidance and options for me on my path. People really do make the world go round, and in a year where restrictions have been placed on who we can see and when, the oxymoronic connection with communication that I think many of us have had this year is startling, humbling, and the inherent need to stay connected with all of **my** people is something I desperately want to take into 2021. I love with all my heart, and I want to continue to use this energy to connect, innovate, and support, both technologically and personally. 

## The TL;DR

- Completed Dissertation (*Harmon: An extensible peer-to-peer platform to enable standardised business-to-business data transactions*)*, achieved a first class*
- Completed Undergraduate Degree *(Kind of not really; have an integrated masters waiting for me in Sheffield in 2021!), achieved a first class*
- Moved from Sheffield, UK, to Dublin, Ireland
- Began working for AWS' RDS Platform Team, with some very talented and thoughtful people, *didn't mess it up (yet)*
- Connected with those I love immensely, both old and new.

## Into 2021: The Bold Known

> So overall, I had a good 2019. Progressing into 2020, I want to try hard to keep these achievements close to me, and use them as energy for new horizons in the coming months.

It was impossible to know what 2020 would bring, and I don't wish to use this post to start to predict my movements and realisations for the next year. Even though a huge part of my personality loves control and predication, there are a select few areas of life that I prefer to leave to the fuzzier edges of living. However, 2021 is a year with a few guarantees. Despite the heartache, I **will** leave Dublin and return to Sheffield to complete my Masters, signalling a return to the steel city of my dreams, and allowing me to complete my life goal of having an MComp in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I **will** experience both heartache and immense joy, leaving behind a lovely bunch of people in the emerald isle while simultaneously reuniting with old friends. And most of all, I will continue on my journey to observe myself, the people I care about, and the world around us.

I have so much love for the people in my life, and this catch all post could never encapsulate the love I have for so many people. This year, just as the year that preceeded it, I learnt more about myself through my interactions with others, and the points of greatest satisfication came when I really felt I was helping people. And that desire is something I know I will take into 2021 with great excitement. 

It would also be quite nice to play in a band again, because blimey, it has been a while. But who knows eh. Hopefully 2021's year in review will be free from the shackles of our coronavirus captor. Fingers crossed.

If you've got this far, thank you for indulging me. Your support is invaluable. I wish you and yours the best for 2021.

> Keep your chin up, and both feet on the floor. I promise you, it will be okay, eventually, probably.

Tom.
