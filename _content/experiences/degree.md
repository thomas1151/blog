> 2017 - 2022

Through the University of Sheffield, I have been able to develop my skills as a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer, looking at the complex theoreticals behind some of the most innovative areas of Computer Science and engineering available today.

With group software modules like the Software Engineering (82% result), Systems Design & Security (68%), and Software Hut Project (93%) - the latter of which was of such success was spun out into an independent project (Team 17 - ESPENTE Project), I have been able to work with and guide teams through real software problems, working on overcoming unforeseen problems and ensuring that they are never unforeseen again.

Software Engineering Project - I was responsible for the front end development (using an MVC structure through RoR).

With theoretical modules such as Web and Internet Technology (88%), Machines and Intelligence (70%), Human-Machine Interaction and Robotics (66% result), and Java Programming (74%), I learned of theoretical methods of computation and their real world applications, taking notable time to study efficiency and scope of possible implementations.

Through faculty wide efforts such as the Engineering - You're Hired and Global Engineering Project, I have been able to apply my computer science knowedge by suggesting solutions to real world problems in a group setting. Notably, suggesting the monitoring air quality in disadvantaged areas in Kibera (for which my team earned Best Communicated Solution), and suggesting a mesh network for large plant optimal efficiency and safety monitoring (for which my team earned Best Solution).

My 3rd year disseratation on Peer to Peer networks and their use as a grounding for B2B transactions was awarded a first class. I left my BSc year with a 77% average, meaning a first class degree, all before gambling on my current integrated masters.
