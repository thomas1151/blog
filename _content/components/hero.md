Yo! I am a **Software Development Engineer (Full Stack/Web)**, **MComp CompSci + AI Student** at the **University of Sheffield** and a Cornet Player from the North East of England.

I have interests in ownership, visibility and infrastructure, and I like to make systems that work as (and show that they are working as) expected.
