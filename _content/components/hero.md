Yo! I am a **Software Development Engineer** in Dublin at **Amazon Web Services (RDS)**, **Full Stack Contract Web Developer**, and Cornet Player from the North East of England.

I have interests in ownership, visibility and infrastructure, and I like to make systems that work as (and show that they are working as) expected.
