I've been lucky enough to work on a variety of projects, all with real motivation for their organisations. The passion that my clients have for their products and services is astounding, and is a driving factor in my aim to represent them as accurately as possible through the products and services I provide. Some of the works shown on the site are done in my spare time, or as part of my ongoing Computer Science studies.
