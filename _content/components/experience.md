I am an enthusiastic and driven individual whose passion for observability, DevOps, meaningful UI/UX and considered ownership fuels my quest to explore and reimagine systems at any scale. Thinking big, being accountable, and taking an idea from start to finish excites me; I am passionate about computer science and I want to put that passion to good use.

I've worked in two countries, on big and small projects, on websites and back-end spider webs - the bit that interests me the most though? The people. I am continually humbled by the amazing people I have come across, and really, this website, and all the work I've done, are the testament to the people who have helped me on the way; whether that be team-mates, colleagues, or clients.
