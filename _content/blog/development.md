For many years, I have wanted to have my own website, my own space on the internet that is soley mine. From a purely business standpoint, it's a useful asset to have, as it shows potential clients that I'm not making up claims that I know how to make things. From a personal standpoint, it's a creation of pride, proof to myself that I am determined and patient enough to see something through until the end.

The first time I realised this desire was in 2012, when I was just a young, wide eyed comprehensive school student with a dream of providing a opinion/news site about technology. This never seen before concept was something that, despite being rather saturated, offered me the biggest chance of making a site where I was interested enough in the concept to keep up the fight. And so Technology Extra was created. Using Wordpress and the cheapest (i.e free) hosting that I could find, I set to work creating a small website that I could be proud of. With my buzz, I managed to convince my school friends at the time to contribute too - I had 5 people all making content for the site. Sure, some of it wasn't the best journalism going, but it was still ours - our little slice of the internet pie. At its peak Technology Extra was averaging roughly 100 visitors each day, and although in the scale of the big wide internet that is negligible, I was so proud of the work, and the number, that I knew I wanted to keep making things people can use, people can read, and that people can enjoy.

Amongst the thrilling articles there is a heartfealt appeal to repeal CISPA, a utterly non exclusive look at Google Glass, an uninteresting look at a minor YouTube feature and the review of a terrible phone that I gave 4/5 Hashes. It was an age of young naivety and optimism, so don't judge.
Now obviously 2012 was quite a while ago, and I'm pleased to say I've progressed from a wide eyed comprehensive school student to a wide eyed university student instead (that's progress). Technology Extra is long gone, and I am only in contact with 2/5 friends I started the site with. But one thing that hasn't changed is that desire to make things that I can be proud of, and other people can participate in. The development of Technology Extra was the first real taste of the feeling of continued evolution and iteration of a project, always improving and getting closer to the ideals I have planned.

>THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVOURITE THING ABOUT WORKING ON PROJECTS. GOING FORWARD, I WANT TO MAKE THESE PEOPLE, MYSELF, AND HOPEFULLY MY POTENTIAL PARTNERS IN PROJECTS PROUD OF THE WORK I'M DOING.

When I initially started work on this site, I had a rough idea of what I had in mind. I wanted something simple, portfolio-ish, that painted a rough picture of who I was, and what I could do. Planning was done on a piece of A4 lined paper, and contained such helpful wording like "~~~~~~~" in place of actual content. I knew I wanted a title, and a footer, and some words in between - the website was practically finished on the page! Sitting down to start work revealed to me that my brevity might be my undoing.
```php
echo $bigTitle;
  if($words){
    echo $words;
  }
echo $footer;
```
_Shown above, a more detailed plan than my initial starting sketches._  
  
Nonetheless, I got to work cobbling together something to put on my shiny new thomasbarratt.co.uk domain. The original site, for all those not part of the core 12 visitors, had some page mechanics courtesy of scrollmagic.js (http://scrollmagic.io/) which made the site work like some kind of digital paper pile, as who doesn't love sliding a piece of paper over the top of another piece of paper? Because of this the size of every slide really only worked if it was 100% height and 100% width of the current browser window, which as you can imagine, caused some interesting effects on anything that wasn't the 1920x1080 resolution it was developed on. It became such a hassle that I ended up disabling the page effect on mobile so that the experience was somewhat bareable.

It had some cool effects, and it provided me with a starting point for this project. My particular favourite is the Pacifico font 'Thomas Barratt' on the gradient background - aesthetically at least, that was the best bit of the original site. Obviously, this is a one close to my heart (you know, being about me and all), and I really wanted to get it right, so I decided to hit the drawing board again (after settling into university and celebrating Christmas).



That gradient background though - A E S T H E T I C - (http://web.archive.org/web/20180112224559/http://thomasbarratt.co.uk)
By the time I had returned to the drawing board (03/01/18), I had different ideas for what I wanted out of this site. I had just finished my first semester of university, and I realised that life does not start post degree, and that I should make the spotty, curly, wide eyed comprehensive Thomas proud by starting to make websites and products. What better way to improve my skills, give me something to be proud of, and others to enjoy, than to get out there and experience the real world? Ever since working on Technology Extra with some of my best school friends, I've been really lucky to work with some of the friendliest and most supportive people going. I'd list them all here, but I'm not at the Oscars, and if you're still reading the last thing you want to see is a big long list. I would like to give particular thanks however to @Webman_ (Craig Rodway), who gave me my first real shot at developing proper websites in a fancy office in Newcastle. Without him (and the rest of the team at Cloud Data Service, and everyone else who has helped me along the way), I might not even be studying Computer Science. The people have always been my favourite thing about working on projects. Going forward, I want to make these people, myself, and hopefully my potential partners in projects proud of the work I'm doing.

## Conclusion ##


So here we are, with a new Thomas Barratt site, a new year, and hopefully a new set of challenges ready to accomplish. If you're still reading this, thanks for getting to the end - I really want to make an effort to keep this up to date, and share my progress with the various things I'm up to. I'm currently looking for any kind of web/software work that is up for grabs, so if you've read this site and are interested, please drop me a line! Either way, keep an eye on the site for updates on myself and the exciting personal projects I've got coming up this year.

Cheers,

T.
