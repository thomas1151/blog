subtitle: 'I review my 2019, taking time to spill emotional nonsense about personal growth.'
summary: "Personal growth is a meta-construct that I know people are keen to shy away from. Introspective ballet, where one is to dance, grapple, with themselves and try and evaluate objectively the actions, but more importantly the thoughts and feelings is something I have often seen people try and repress. And I'm not to criticise that repression;it can often seem like a pointless endeavour. The only way to grow in a skill or ability is to do it, not think about it."

> A good year is difficult to define, but a bad one isn't. An alright year? Well, now we're talking.

![Gdansk 2019.](/assets/posts/2019-yeah-it-was-alright-i-suppose/cover.jpg "Gdansk 2019.")

The days start, the weeks end. The months begin, the years pass away. And just as the millennia of previous years, 2019 has not broken the trend. Generally, 2019 was a positive year for me. I'm fortunate, I come from a time and place where I don't have to worry about my safety, or my health, even if others are not so lucky. After some personal tumultuous flash-points that I can point to through the year, I'd say that generally, I leave 2019 and enter 2020 not desiring a 'new year, new me', but rather, 'new year, same me, with the stipulation that I continue to grow in a similar way to that of the latter half of the previous year' - although I can see why the former mindset has gained more traction.

> NEW YEAR, SAME ME, WITH THE STIPULATION THAT I CONTINUE TO GROW IN A SIMILAR WAY TO THAT OF THE LATTER HALF OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR.


Personal growth is a meta-construct that I know people are keen to shy away from. Introspective ballet, where one is to dance, grapple, with themselves and try and evaluate objectively the actions, but more importantly the thoughts and feelings is something I have often seen people try and repress. And I'm not to criticise that repression; it can often seem like a pointless endeavour. The only way to grow in a skill or ability is to do it, not think about it.

But really, evaluation of personal growth is in itself a skill. The ability to evaluate your ability, to operate on this meta level and to use this additional information to guide yourself is valuable, and the best parts of 2019 came when I was able to think objectively about my life, my actions, and the thoughts and feelings behind it all.

I pride myself on being a thoughtful, caring (and I do believe there is a distinction between the two) and reliable individual. I would hope that if you ask any of my close friends, at least one of these words would pop up. What I have found, however, is the result of this desire to be the best I can be for the people around me produces anxieties and emotions that must be controlled; not repressed, but evaluated and sorted. Ensuring that I can work to remove the emotional congestion from my head has been essential. But to abstract this, to be able to consider a situation, and evaluate it and its consequences on a meta level, and then make some mental decision on the situation - does the situation matter, how much does it matter, is it worth devoting time and stress about etc , is the core ability I want to take further in 2020. I want to try and be more realistic when it comes to what I prioritise: prioritising everything as priority 1 doesn't actually solve anything.

So 2019 was a year of growth of me. I have learnt more about who I am, where my weaknesses lie, and where I come from: I see elements in me in my family members, role models from my teenage years, and my friends. And despite the personal changes that have perhaps forced me to begin this process, I am still thankful for the year, and for the opportunities that presented themselves to me.

To move gradually away from the introspective dirge above, 2019 presented some fantastic opportunities which I have been incredibly grateful for.



I was able to travel to fantastic areas of Europe: Gdansk, Poland and Budapest, Hungary were both incredible trips which I cannot sum up into words. Everything becomes an adventure when you're away on holiday, especially when you're staying in Airbnbs. Trips to the shops become an delve into the culture of shopping of the country: ham isn't called ham, and doesn't taste like ham, and wait a minute, maybe this isn't ham! Getting around public transport in Europe is like nothing else, and in Poland and Hungary, put the UK to shame. Trams rattle along picturesque tracks, trains zip you around districts for a price less than that of a coffee, and buses arrive on time.

And your company, they become essential. You learn more about them on holiday in 10 minutes than you do at home. Especially at airports, or when you're lost, or when you're tired or hungry, and especially when you're all of these things at once. I have been incredibly lucky to spend time at these places with fantastic people, and the experiences of those trips will stay with me forever.



Work wise and educationally, I have also had a fairly good year. The first half of the year brought a respectable but personally disappointing 2:1 result for my second year at university, something which I'm aiming to top this year. Despite achieving 93% in my software engineering module, my theory exams did not go as successfully. But it also brought exciting new projects, and the requirement to try and source a year in industry placement for the summer 2020 - summer 2021.

I was fortunate to finish a 6 month contract with an insurance provider at the start of the year. They were incredibly good to me, and I owe them a lot.

Work on the Evidence Gap Mapping Software for Epilepsy Action, and the School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield was a particular highlight, working with passionate health and research teams to provide an extensible evidence gap mapping software not present anywhere else, and to then release that on the National Epilepsy Association's website, was a incredibly highlight. Managing the team and developing the software was a great opportunity, and I thank everyone involved for providing a great environment for some great software.

I continued work on Fireplace DMS, my in-house data management software for managing small businesses. Although still a million years away from the big time, I chipped away at the long road map ahead, and got enough functionality that I no longer have to pop into the database to do the main simple tasks (new invoice, document, job, person, organisation, and location). By working on the database structure, I was able to bring better relationships to all the areas mentioned above, and also can manage different datasets using the same instance. No longer do I have to maintain different Fireplace instances for different businesses/projects, but instead can switch between using a login domain instead.

Trelloverview was published this year, my multi-board Trello routing software, all written in React, and tested in Jest. This was a big step for me. As a big believer of the 90-90 rule (the last 10% takes 90% of the time), bringing something to the point where I felt comfortable enough to release it was no easy feat. Comprehensive testing and clear planning allowed me to develop confidence in my software, and that is a good feeling!

Securing a year in industry was also on the cards at the end of 2019. Essentially a year long internship, after which I return to Sheffield to complete the Masters component of my integrated Masters degree, finding somewhere which I wanted to work, and also would be a good fit, was no easy feat. As a optimistic but fearful about the future 20 year old, I felt it was important to take this seriously, and try and find somewhere that can provide me with insight into project composition, management and the varying workflows of professional developers. I want to learn as much as possible about development, teamwork and large project management. Although confirmed, I cannot say where I'll be working yet, but I will try and keep you in the loop.

So in terms of my experience this year, I have had some great opportunities to develop personally and professionally. And I hope the people who have helped me through the experiences above will agree that I not only took them seriously, but did also grow as a result of them.

Finally, I joined a new brass band, playing 2nd Solo Cornet for the South Yorkshire Police Band. This is a great honour for me, and something that I am not taking lightly! Playing music is a great pleasure of mine, and being able to play it under the name of South Yorkshire Police, with the fantastic musicians which make up the band, is a defining time for me. I feel lucky that I have been able to trick them all into thinking I have some musical skill!



So overall, I had a good 2019. Progressing into 2020, I want to try hard to keep these achievements close to me, and use them as energy for new horizons in the coming months. Although this blog has not been updated in quite a while, over the last few months I have begun writing periodical updates, which I hope I continue to do and start to share in the new year.

Thanks for reading all this, kind stranger. Keep your chin up, and both feet on the floor. I promise you, it will be okay, eventually, probably.

All the best,

Tom.
