> [type up from book]

Days like this are the hardest to write in. An overpowering sense of melancholy and dislocation overpower the senses, reducing clarity and removing concentration from the picture entirely.

I have been doing a fair bit of introspection and reading lately. I am very keen to know more, in every sense. The paralysis of existing knowledge, which provides an immeasurable comfort, is something I am keen to extract myself from. 

> The paralysis of existing knowledge, which provides an immeasurable comfort, is something I am keen to extract myself from.  

But really, it's more than that. It's not so much about taking risks as realigning your drive to be based on something other than comfort. The great human condition ensures that largely, we will tend to the same indifferent state regardless of the scenario we find ourselves in: we will adapt. Instead, directing energy into pursuing serendipity is the way to prompt meaningful change in life: comfort gets your nowhere.

Irrespective of this, the one thing that is a principal component of comfort is companionship. I can say with full confidence that tonight, I am in need of such comfort. A hollow wave of loneliness and emptiness has spread through me today. After entering the day with a youthful hopefulness, I leave with a longing for comfort and belonging.


Perhaps tonight I feel like an unknown unknown. As is the nature of moving to new places, I feel observable but unseen; present but intangible. Only the presence of someone who can perceive what is often called the 'inner you' can tend to such issues. I suppose often that tender is yourself, but without any internal grounding, the situation I find myself in tonight, you become unobservable and lost, adrift in the sea of indifference and unimportance.

I have so much to give, that I'm sure of. I'm unsure in what capacity I am going to give this however. Is this knowledge, or emotion? I am under the impression that something *big* is about to happen. I'd bet money on it in fact. What this big thing is, I do not know, but I feel it within. It creeps in my stomach, unsettling the butterflies which fly sporadically, provoking diary entries such as this.
