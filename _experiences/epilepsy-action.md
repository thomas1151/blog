Epilepsy Action commissioned researchers at the University of Sheffield to carry out a systematic mapping review, looking at evidence to describe the role of the epilepsy specialist nurse. They looked at the type and quality of the evidence and the evidence gaps. All papers identified were ‘mapped’ (see below) according to the sub-roles and the type of evidence.

Originally a group in a software module at university, due to the quality of output the team produced, the initial proof of concept was further developed into the fully fledged version in use today. The scope of this project was to develop a new Evidence Gap Map tool for an upcoming report for Epilepsy Action (the British Epilepsy Association). Our tool is used to navigate the data which the report discusses.

The tool produced features an interactive table output, with the various different categories which papers can belong in represented as proportional circles. Alongside the responsive front end visible to any visitor of the Epilepsy Action site, a private CMS runs the tool, allowing for the continued maintenance of the content as time goes on.

The team consists of:

- Thomas Barratt
- Harley Everett
- Jack Ashurst
- Colin Zack
